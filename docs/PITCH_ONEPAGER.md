## Global Digital Infrastructure for the Wood & Wood-Products Industry

---

## 1. The Problem

The global wood and wood-products industry operates on fragmented, opaque, and trust-heavy processes.  
Quality disputes, inconsistent grading, unverifiable inventories, payment risk, and regulatory complexity create systemic friction in cross-border trade.

Despite its scale, the industry still relies on manual verification, disconnected intermediaries, and non-standardized data.

## 2. The Solution

Nettreemarket is a digital infrastructure platform that standardizes how wood products are listed, verified, tracked, and exchanged.

We are not a brokerage or commission-based marketplace.  
We provide the infrastructure layer that enables trusted B2B and B2C transactions through:

- Standardized product and quality representation  
- Digital inventory and documentation readiness  
- Compliance-first, modular architecture  
- Future integration of AI, asset digitization, and financial rails  

Nettreemarket becomes the neutral backbone connecting producers, traders, warehouses, and institutional buyers.

## 3. Why Now

Three forces converge now:

- Global pressure for traceability, ESG, and compliance  
- Digitization of industrial supply chains  
- Institutional demand for structured, verifiable real-world assets  

The wood industry has reached a point where analog processes are no longer acceptable at scale.

## 4. Why Us

- Founders with multi-generation, hands-on experience in the wood trade  
- Deep understanding of grading, logistics, disputes, and real market pain  
- Platform built from industry reality, not theory  
- Structured for global expansion, not local experimentation  

This is infrastructure designed by insiders.

## 5. Roadmap Snapshot

- Phase 1: Core platform, data structure, documentation, compliance readiness  
- Phase 2: AI-assisted quality, inventory, and workflow automation  
- Phase 3: Trade enablement, integrations, and ecosystem partnerships  
- Phase 4: Financial modules, ESG tracking, and asset tokenization  

---

## 6. The Ask

We are raising capital to:

- Accelerate product development and platform stability  
- Onboard strategic partners and early institutional users  
- Prepare legal, compliance, and infrastructure foundations for scale  

Nettreemarket is being built as long-term global infrastructure, not a short-cycle marketplace.
